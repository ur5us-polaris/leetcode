# leetcode
My solutions for [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) challenges, in Python.
Generally, Python gives you easy time solving algo challenges, i.e list.sort. Since I focus on solving algorithm challenges, I treated these as "cheats" and used them as less as possible.
Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions!
